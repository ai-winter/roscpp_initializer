# roscpp_initializer

Catkin package with python bindings for roscpp to ensure that `ros::init()` and `ros::shutdown()` are called appropiately. Code adapted from moveit's [ROScppInitializer Class](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/moveit_ros_planning_interface/html/classmoveit_1_1py__bindings__tools_1_1ROScppInitializer.html). For use case, see ROS tutorial on how to use a [C++ Class with ROS Messages in Python](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/Using%20a%20C%2B%2B%20class%20in%20Python#Class_with_NodeHandle).
